# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
*To establish an origin connection between the local Clone and the remote Repository, forked or not, we can use the Git Remote command with the Add Origin operand followed by the name of the Repository in question while in the correct directory; this will establish the remote Repository as the correct address for the local Clone and allow pushing information from the local to the remote. This is the SS-specific method, but there are others.*

## Additional Changes
- *I am interested in potential remote-local connection alternatives.*
- *I am not interested enough to seek out that information now.*
